# To Compile and Execute Code
## Option 1: OnlineGDB (HIGH PREFERED)
- Unzip the folder "Le_U52555883_Hexagon".zip
- Go online to the URL --> https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler
- Select the extracted folder of "Le_U52555883_Hexagon(2)" and upload the "PythonHexagonLonger.py" in to compiler
- You can also copy the code from the .py file onto the interface to operate
- Click on Green button to run the python file

## Option 2: Visual studio Code or IDE
### 1. Prerequisites
-Have Visual Studio Code preinstalled to your device
-Install the python from (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-Download details and setup  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial (this works for python)
-Have the correct extentions and Interpreter for IDE
### 2. Enviroment set up
-Unzip the folder "Le_U52555883_IHexagon(2)".zip
- Open Visual Studio Code and select "Open Folder". Select the extracted folder of "Le_U52555883_Hexagon(2)"
- On the left side or "Explorer" click on the file that says "PythonHexagonLonger.py" to see the code
- Click on Terminal on the top left, and select new terminal
### 3. Running the Terminal
- Make sure terminal displays "path to file"\Le_U52555883_Hexagon(2)\ . Must be in the submitted project directory to run
-type "py" to open the python script
- Type "python3 PythonHexagonLonger.py" or "python PythonHexagonLonger.py". If this doesn't work, please follow the tutorial on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial for correct run syntax
- When inserting edges as player 2, do it in this syntax: "(vertice)-(vertice)"
